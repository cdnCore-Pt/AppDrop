# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Nextcloud 33 support (`max-version="33"`); verified end-to-end on 33.0.8 and 30.0.17

### Fixed
- Updating an app (or restoring a backup / re-installing after a remove) left `installed_version` behind, so Nextcloud answered 503 "upgrade needed" to every request until `occ upgrade` was run manually. AppDrop now runs the app's upgrade routine itself (`IAppManager::upgradeApp()` on NC 32+, `OC_App::updateApp()` on NC 30/31)
- `AppInstallException` moved to its own file: it was only autoloadable after `AppInstallService` had been loaded, which turned errors in the Backups/Apps tabs into a fatal "Class not found"
- Generated app skeletons hard-coded `max-version="32"` and could not be enabled on NC 33; the value now follows the running server
- Settings tab showed a stale hard-coded version label

### Changed
- Controllers use `#[NoAdminRequired]` / `#[NoCSRFRequired]` attributes instead of docblock annotations (deprecated, logged on every request by NC 33); the generated skeleton controller does the same
- Upload form uses the template `requesttoken` instead of the deprecated `Util::callRegister()`
- Dev dependency `nextcloud/ocp` pinned to `^33.0` (`dev-master` now requires PHP 8.3); CI matrix is PHP 8.2–8.4. Runtime requirement stays PHP 8.1+ for NC 30

## [1.3.4] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- Use the App Store schema's enumerated SPDX casing (`AGPL-3.0-or-later`) in `info.xml` — the lowercase form was rejected by the store's `info.xsd` validation

## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- Sign the App Store package against the shipped tree instead of the dev tree, so Nextcloud's integrity check no longer reports missing files at install time
- Unify packaging excludes into a single `.nextcloudignore` consumed by both the script and the release workflow

### Added
- `--register-sig` helper to print the one-time signature required by the App Store "Register app" form
- Package contract test (`tests/test-package.sh`) wired into CI

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Strengthen badge colors for status indicators (Enabled/Disabled/Error) to be legible in both dark and light themes

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Remove max-width cap on content sections so they fill the full viewport
- Fix apps table using `max-content` width instead of filling available space

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Detailed health check checklist with visual indicators and per-check status
- Fix hints in health check results to guide users on resolving issues
- Self-update prevention: blocks uploading AppDrop through itself

### Fixed
- Always register navigation entry to prevent Nextcloud 32 crash
- Icon color for light theme compatibility
- Hide navigation from users without upload permission
- Add `@NoAdminRequired` to controllers to allow permitted non-admin users
- Strengthen warning/error colors for better contrast in light theme

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Nextcloud-standard sidebar navigation (replaces horizontal tabs)
- Permission system: admin can grant upload access to specific users and groups
- Permissions management UI with user/group search autocomplete
- PermissionService for access control via IConfig app values
- PermissionController with CRUD and search API endpoints

### Changed
- UI redesigned to follow Nextcloud's `#app-navigation` / `#app-content` layout pattern
- Admin-only sections (Apps, Backups, Permissions) hidden from non-admin users via PHP
- Upload, History, Generator sections accessible to permitted users (not just admins)
- Generator section improved: renamed to "App Skeleton Generator", added file structure preview
- All upload-related controllers now use `canUpload()` instead of `denyIfNotAdmin()`
- Bumped version to 1.2.0

### Removed
- Horizontal tab navigation (tabs.php, tabs.js)
- Legacy admin.js upload handler
